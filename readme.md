# This Repo houses a sample NODEJS WEB service

### Usade for my TDD course

- I have a Udemy course which uses this repo on a particular section
- The goal of using this Repo is to facilitate the undertanding of a quality
  strategy when building an application of this nature.

### It is viable for general use however

- This structure will provide a way to develop and evolve a service structured
  with hexagonal architecture in mind and Test as a way to deternmine design of
  solutions.
